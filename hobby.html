<h1>My Hobby</h1>
<center>
<p>
My hobby is to play Football and Squash. 
i play football in school and i play squash at my club call SquashED.
Hobby means the sport the you like and the sport you learn.
Your hobby does not have to be a sport, it can be even Studying.
You always have to play or do the things you like, not just for the fun of it.
Then you can learn something.
If you do something you do not like, you are ust wasting your time.

Swimming is a great workout because you need to move your whole
 body against the resistance of the water.
 Swimming is a good all-round activity because it:
 keeps your heart rate up but takes some of the impact stress off your body. 
 builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness.
